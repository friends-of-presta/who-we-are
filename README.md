## About the PrestaShop company

We're not related in any way to the PrestaShop company and - so on - this organization is not administrated by PrestaShop employees.
You may meet some PrestaShop employees on the Slack, but keep in mind that official developer channel is on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PrestaShop/General).

## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct can be found [here](https://github.com/friends-of-presta/open-source/tree/master/code-of-conduct).

## Coding conventions

As for now, the modules and code samples should follow [Prestashop coding standards](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/coding-standards/) ( PSR-2 standard, Symfony standards, ...) and naming convention but it's not absolutely required : usefull stuff first.
PHP CS Fixer with prestashop settings can be used.
